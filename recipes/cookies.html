    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I made these chocolate chip cookies for the birthday of my roommate, and everyone loved them!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cold, cubed butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 extra egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed chocolate chips (semi-sweet and bittersweet)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the cold, cubed butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Begin mixing on low speed, gradually increasing speed. Continue creaming the butter and sugars together for 4 to 5 minutes until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in the mixer. Mix on low speed until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix briefly until evenly distributed. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Place dough balls onto a baking sheet and bake for 6 minutes. Lift the baking sheet and drop it back onto the oven rack to help the cookies spread.</li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to overbake. The cookies should be golden on the edges and soft in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt if desired.</li>
    </ol>
